# knight-tour-neural-network
This is a python implementation of knight tour problem using neural networks. The algorithm is much slower than common algorithms for solving knight's tour though im my opinion it has an interesting implmentation.

several snapshots of the algorithm has been added.

for more information about the algorithm visit https://dmitrybrant.com/knights-tour.

for the **warnsdroff rule** version of knight's tour please visit https://github.com/NiloofarShahbaz/knight-tour-warnsdroff.

## Usage
- #### with GUI
    - install the requiremnts in the *requirements.txt* file.
    - you can change the **board size** in line 22 of *main.py* file.
    - run *main.py*.
- #### without GUI
    - install numpy.
    - uncomment the 2 last lines in *knight_tour.py*(and you can change the board size).
    - run *knight_tour.py*.
